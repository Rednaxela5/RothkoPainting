# Rothko Painting
The purpose of this repo is to monitor my progress in learning HTML and CSS by making a basic Rothko Painting. I am utilizing the freeCodeCamp's [Learn CSS Box Model by Building a Rothko Painting](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/#learn-the-css-box-model-by-building-a-rothko-painting) for this repo.
